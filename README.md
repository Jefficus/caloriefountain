<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

1/3 of children in Canada go to bed hungry at least once a week because their families can't afford groceries, yet current indoor farming ventures seem focused on leafy "supplemental" crops — growing salads for the middle class — because that's where the money is that can provide a return for their investors.

But what if we used those same technologies to bring food security to those who don't have it? Better yet, instead of selling the food to them, what if we could show them how to build their own system and grow a nutritionally sufficient diet they could live on indefinitely?

Well I'm pleased to report that my preliminary investigation suggested that it is indeed plausible. I haven't put it all to the test yet, but that's what this project is all about — figuring out how to turn "plausible" into "actual". I call my solution a "Calorie Fountain," and I'm optimistic enough about it that I think it's worth pursuing the rest of this work publicly, in the hope that others might be interested in following along, or maybe even getting involved.

This repository is for a simple website that contains a complete and up-to-date record of my research, experiments, datasets, software, blog posts, discussions, and data analyses, organized so anyone who wants to can download the whole thing and have a completely working copy on a computer in their own home. Or even on a thumb drive.

### Assumptions
In order to make the CalorieFountain applicable to the widest number of circumstances and regions, I'm not depending on any one set of assumptions or constraints. For some people, access to electric power might be an issue, while others may have to get by without running water. Some may live in a region where they'll be able to plant outdoors year-round, while others may be restricted to indoor operation for large parts of the year. This means that there can be no "one-size-fits-all" solution. So instead, CalorieFountain will recommend a solution tailored to whatever input parameters you specify. But in order to build the most versatile system possible, my own efforts are being conducted under the assumption that Calorie Fountain will have to provide its own power, heat, and light. I figure that if I can get it running in a cold and lightless cave, you can probably get it running wherever you live. I call this the Cave<sub>0</sub> Scenario.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

We'd love to see you on the site, getting involved in the discussion, or maybe even helping to do some of the research, but if you just want to download the website and run it locally, do the following:

1. Clone this repo to your local machine
2. That's it. You're done. Just open a browser on the index.html file at the root of the repo and browse from there.


### Prerequisites

None. Well, a computer of some kind with a web browser installed, but other than that, nothing.

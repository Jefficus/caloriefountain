Good question. Depending on my mood and blood sugar levels, I've most often answered that with one of: computer scientist, creativity theorist, fantasy and science fiction author, computer animation consultant, or tech entrepreneur. But recently I've added another title to that strange roulette wheel: experimental indoor farmer.</p>
<p>I should stress that my PhD is in computer science, not agriculture or biology. I'm not even an experienced gardener. But I think that's a strength in this particular case. You don't want to be following a complicated laboratory protocol laid down by a team of research chemists and biology theorists â€” you want something easy. Something a schmoe like me could figure out. </p>
<p>Because then there's a good chance you'll be able to do it too.</p>

<h1>Dead To Me</h1>
<p>I've made the decision to abandon my social media presence wherever black-box content-filtering algorithms are used, because I believe they are dividing society into silos and poisoning public discourse. If we don't have control over what we see, I won't participate. So far, that list includes:</p>

<p>Anybody who has tried to educate themselves about lighting for indoor farming can tell you that it's like the midway at a county carnival out there. Every patch of grass and empty lot is filled with carnies and hucksters trying to entice you into their tent. <em>Our lights will plant the seeds, hoe the weeds, and by gum, they'll even harvest the crop and cook you dinner.</em></p>
<p>This is my attempt to douse them all with a garden hose and try to drag some sense into the discussion.</p>

<p>On the surface, there’s a lot to consider: 
Wattage, emission spectra, power consumption, color temperature, ppu, ffpma, and so on, and so on.</p>
<p>Some people say you need to use lights specifically designed for plants, others say you can use regular household lights.</p>
<p>With every huckster barking for your money, it's a cacophony that makes you just want to run away screaming.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I'm not at the stage where I'm trying to pick lights for a production calorie fountain — I'm just trying to figure out a lab setup, where I'll be conducting many, small experiments in parallel. I might have a dozen different types of plants at 10 different stages of growth, so I’ll probably be better off dedicating a smaller light to each experiment, specifically chosen to suit the needs of those plants.</p>
<p>With larger lights, I think there's more light leakage - larger lights hanging higher up to accommodate a wider range of growth heights in the bed below. So the light is further away and much of it is absorbed by things other than leaves. My working theory is that smaller beds with smaller, closer lights will allow me the most flexibility for running lots of experiments. It also limits my losses if/when a light fails.</p>

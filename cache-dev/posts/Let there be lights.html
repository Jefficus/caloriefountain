<p><img class="float-right blogthumb" src="/posts/images/fountain-godrays.jpg">Eventually, designing a cheap, efficient, and robust lighting system for the fountain is going to be a project of its own, but in the meantime I still need some kind of lighting in the lab to provide consistent, controllable conditions for my experiments. But aside from the light that came attached to my Aerogarden, I have zero experience with grow lights.</p>
<p>So howâ€™s an inexperienced gardener like me supposed to choose?</p>

<p>At the moment, my lab is more of an idea than a reality. Just a few scattered corners of the house where I can leave a pot or two to germinate without risk of intrusion from the dog or the kids. (I'm working on creating a larger space, but I don't really need it yet. More on that later.)</p>
<p>So for now, what I really need is an LED panel that throws the right wavelengths for plants. Nothing too big, as it'll get moved from space to space for a while and some of those spaces might be fairly cramped. On the other hand, I want it to be bigger than the Aerogarden light because I might have a dozen or more seedlings going at a time.</p>
<p>In the end, I've decided that I won't know what I <em>really</em> need until I've used one for a while, so it really doesn't matter which light I start with. On that basis, I've opted for <a href="https://a.co/d/ieZvQKk">this 75 W panel from Roleadro</a>. It gets pretty solid reviews on Amazon, and is affordable enough that if it doesn't pan out, I won't feel cheated.</p>
<p>But now that it's on its way, I'm getting kind of excited, because this was the last thing I needed to complete my Junior Scientist Grow-lab Startup Kit. In just a few more days, I'll be able to get some seedlings started and let the testing begin.</p>

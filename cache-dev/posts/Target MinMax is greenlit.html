<p>GOAL: Develop code to find an optimal mix of crops based on both nutritional yield and caloric power.</p>
<!-- TEASER_END -->
<hr class='teaserbreak'>
<h1>Explanation</h1>
<p>Focusing on crops with the highest caloric power is a good start, but we should provide options that balance the nutritional payload as well. A fountaineer can then choose which crop mix will best suit their needs. But first we need the data and a method to choose the optimal mix.</p>
<h1>Deliverables</h1>
<ul>
<li>nutritional yield data for all crops</li>
<li>recommended daily intake for each nutrient</li>
<li>code to produce the optimal mix</li>
</ul>
<h1>Success conditions</h1>
<ul>
<li>code produces a crop mix that satisfies all given constraints</li>
</ul>

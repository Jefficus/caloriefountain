<p>GOAL: Determine whether it is feasible for an indoor farm to be run by one person in reasonable space and produce enough calories to sustain them indefinitely.</p>

<hr class='teaserbreak'>
<h1>Explanation</h1>
<p>It seems obvious that a person working alone, outdoors, could produce enough food to survive year-round by going hard during the growing season and then storing the excess for the off-season. But in a food crisis, outdoor gardens are vulnerable to pilfering, unpredictable weather, and pests. So Project Calorie Fountain will explore indoor, year-round production.</p>
<h1>Deliverables</h1>
<ul>
<li>a list of candidate crops</li>
<li>a data table measuring the caloric power of each crop</li>
</ul>
<h1>Success conditions</h1>
<ul>
<li>multiple potential crops identified</li>
<li>requires small enough space to fit inside a single room in a typical family home</li>
<li>no special skills required</li>
<li>no equipment required that can't be found in a typical hardware store or small town garden center<ul>
<li>e.g. no fancy electronics, chemicals or materials</li>
</ul>

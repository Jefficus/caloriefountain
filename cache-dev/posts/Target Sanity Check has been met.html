<!-- Executive Summary -->
<p>Several crops were identified with sufficient yield to meet daily caloric needs indefinitely, in the context of a small-footprint indoor farm. </p>
<p>RECOMMENDATION: Proceed with trial crops of salsify, kelp, and leek.</p>

<h1>Methodology</h1>
<ul>
<li>Surveyed the internet for discussions about high-caloric yield crops and built up a list of candidates. </li>
<li>Did some independent digging for a few possibilities that I hadn't seen discussed anywhere else.</li>
<li>Assembled a spreadsheet of candidates</li>
<li>Researched crop yields in bushels/acre or pounds/acre in regional farm reports</li>
<li>Researched calories per pound in reputable nutrition databases</li>
<li>Converted bushels into pounds for all bushel/acre yield values</li>
<li>Gathered approximate seed-to-harvest cycle times for all crops, based on seed supplier data sheets</li>
<li>Computed approximate caloric power (cals/sqft/day) for all crops</li>
<li>Estimated sqft/person fountain space requirements for each crop (assuming 2000 cal/day/person requirement)</li>
<li>Of these, seaweed, salsify, sweet potatoes, potatoes, leeks, and oats all had space needs &lt; 1000 sqft/person</li>
<li>But seaweed and salsify require &lt; 1/3 the space of all other candidates </li>
</ul>

<p>GOAL: Demonstrate that seaweed can be grown in a fountain system and still yield a caloric power of 6.9 or better.</p>
<!-- TEASER_END -->
<hr class='teaserbreak'>
<h1>Explanation</h1>
<p>In theory, seaweed should be <em>the</em> rock star crop of the Calorie Fountain system, but I don't know that its commercial grow stats will hold up under Fountain conditions. This target will either prove them true and provide a first approximation of the necessary growing system; or prove them false and provide us with updated metrics for the crop table.</p>
<h1>Deliverables</h1>
<ul>
<li>a new caloric power rating for seaweed</li>
<li>a determination of which species is optimal</li>
<li>a design for a basic seaweed growing system</li>
</ul>
<h1>Success conditions</h1>
<ul>
<li>we can actually grow some in the fountain</li>
<li>measured caloric power â‰¥ 6.9</li>
</ul>

Good question. Depending on my mood and blood sugar levels, I've most often answered that with one of: computer scientist, creativity theorist, fantasy and science fiction author, computer animation consultant, or tech entrepreneur. But recently I've added another title to that strange roulette wheel: experimental indoor farmer.

I should stress that I am neither a biologist nor even an experienced farmer, but I think that's a strength for this particular project. You don't want to be trying to follow the precise protocols laid out by a team of research chemists and biology theorists â€” you want to be following a schmoe like me, because anything I can achieve, you can do better.

# Connection Points

- Creativity Hacker (my main website)
- Reddit
- WT.Social (Wikipedia's experiment in ethical social media)
- Disqus
- Discord

# Dead To Me
I've made the decision to abandon my social media presence wherever black-box content-filtering algorithms are used, because I believe they are dividing society into silos and destroying public discourse. If we don't have control over what we see, I won't participate. So far, that list includes:

- Facebook
- Twitter
- TikTok

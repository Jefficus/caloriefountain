        <p>I call it a "calorie fountain" — an indoor farming system that can feed a small family during a crisis and fit within a single room of a suburban home.</p>
        <p>Slam-dunk success would be a system that can support three adults indefinitely, while being self-sufficient for all its power, light and heating needs. But I'll take anything that doesn't poison the family and set fire to the dog.</p>
        </p>
        <p>I also hope to build a community of <i>fountaineers</i> who are intrigued by the idea and want to get involved. Drop a comment somewhere and let me know you're here.</p>

        <p>The natural world is trying to pay us dividends on our hubris, and no matter which payments we try to stop, the chances of stopping them all in time seems grim.</p>

        <p>What happens then? Well, there’s one tipping point I see that could very well trigger a collapse. If we panicked over a hiccup in the <i>toilet paper</i> supply, just imagine what will happen when it's the <i>food aisles</i> that are empty.</p>

        <p>So, as a wise man once said, "Be as optimistic as you like. Just be sure you've got a Plan B." Think of Project Calorie Fountain as my Plan B. (See <a href="/mission">Mission</a> for more.)</p>

# Organization
All the work I'm doing to develop the calorie fountain will be posted here. This site will always be up-to-date with the most recent plans and suggestions, and can be downloading onto a laptop or even a thumb drive and viewed in your browser in any operating system and without having to install any other tools. 

The site is organized into 3 main sections: 

- [Lab Notes](/priority/labnotes) - think of these as the project water cooler. It's where you'll find ideas, thoughts about the project, and minor status updates about the various active investigations
- [Milestones](/priority/milestones) - think of these as "Reports to Management." These are the more official posts I make to propose new investigation targets and report on their status
- [Panic Room](/priority/panic) - the button you hit if you suddenly need to know how to build a calorie fountain RIGHT NOW

        <p>A calorie fountain is an indoor farming system that can keep a small family fed during a crisis. Slam-dunk success would be a system that can feed three adults indefinitely, while being self-sufficient for its power, light and heating needs. But I'll take anything that doesn't poison the family and set fire to the dog.</p>
        </p>
        <p>Along the way, I hope to also build a community of <i>fountaineers</i> who are intrigued by the idea. Drop a comment somewhere and let me know you're here.</p>

        <p>Most modern cities have about 10 days worth of food on hand, yet a single traffic accident in the Suez Canal disrupted global supply chains for almost a year, and frankly, that discrepancy makes me nervous.</p>
        <p>I believe human ingenuity can solve any problem we face, but as a wise man once said, "Optimism is great. Just be sure you've got a Plan B."</p> 
        <p>Well, Project Calorie Fountain is my Plan B.</p>

# Organization
All the work I'm doing to develop the calorie fountain will be posted here. This site will always be up-to-date with the most recent plans and suggestions, and can be downloading onto a laptop or even a thumb drive and viewed in your browser in any operating system and without having to install any other tools. 

The site is organized into 3 main sections: 

- **Lab Notes** - think of these as the project water cooler. It's where you'll find ideas, thoughts about the project, and minor status updates about the various active investigations
- **Milesontes** - think of these as "Reports to Management." These are the more official posts I make to propose new investigation targets and report on their status
- **Panic Room** - the button you hit if you suddenly need to know how to build a calorie fountain RIGHT NOW

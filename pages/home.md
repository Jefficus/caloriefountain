        <p>If there's anything the pandemic taught us
        Supply chains are more fragile than we realized.
        City's only have 10 days of food
        A 6-day interruption in the Suez canal caused disruptions that lasted almost a year. And frankly, the discrepancy has me worried.
        If we run out of toilet paper, people aren't going to abandon their jobs to lock down their Charmin support, but if it's the hamburger freezer or the French fries aisle that runs dry, we've got trouble. What if your city runs out of bread and milk?

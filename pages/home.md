        <p>A calorie fountain is an indoor farming system that can be operated by a single person 
        to produce sufficient calories and nutrients to feed their family indefinitely.
        <p>In its final form, it will be capable of feeding a family of 3, year-round, and be entirely self-sufficient for the power, light and heat required to grow its crops.</p>
        </p>
        <p>Hopefully, I'm also building a community of <i>fountaineers</i> who are interested in the idea. Let me know you're there by commenting on the posts you find interesting.</p>

        <p>Most modern cities have about 10 days worth of food on hand, yet a single traffic accident in the Suez Canal disrupted global supply chains for almost a year, and frankly, that discrepancy makes me nervous.</p>
        <p>I believe human ingenuity can solve any problem we face, but as a wise man once said, "Optimism is great. Just be sure you've got a Plan B."</p> 
        <p>Well, Project Calorie Fountain is my Plan B.</p>

# Organization
All the work I'm doing to develop the calorie fountain will be posted here. This site will always be up-to-date with the most recent plans and suggestions, and can be downloading onto a laptop or even a thumb drive and viewed in your browser in any operating system and without having to install any other tools. 

The site is organized into 3 main sections: 

- **Lab Notes** - think of these as the project water cooler. It's where you'll find ideas, thoughts about the project, and minor status updates about the various active investigations
- **Milesontes** - think of these as "Reports to Management." These are the more official posts I make to propose new investigation targets and report on their status
- **Panic Room** - the button you hit if you suddenly need to know how to build a calorie fountain RIGHT NOW

        <p>I call it a "calorie fountain" — an indoor farming system that can feed a small family and fit within a single room of a suburban home.</p>

        <p>Early systems won't be as efficient, but in the long term, a calorie fountain should be able to supply the full nutritional needs of three adults, all year, and cost less than $200/month to operate.</p>

        <p>I also hope to build a community of <i>fountaineers</i> who are intrigued by the idea and want to get involved. If that's you, Step 1 is to engage in the comments.</p>

        <p> 1/5 of children in Canada go to bed hungry at least once a week because their families can't afford groceries. But current indoor farming ventures seem focused on leafy "supplemental" crops — growing salads for the middle class — because that's where the money is that can provide a return for their investors.</p>

        <p>I think that same technology could be used to bring food security to those who don't already have it, by showing them how to build a system for themselves that makes them nutritionally self-sufficient. Forever.</p>

# Navigation

All the work I'm doing to develop the calorie fountain will be posted here. This site will always be up-to-date with the most recent plans and suggestions, and can be downloaded onto a laptop or even a thumb drive and viewed in your browser in any operating system and without having to install any other tools. 

The site is organized into 3 main sections: 

- [Lab Notes](/priority/labnotes) - Think of these as the project water cooler. It's where you'll find ideas, thoughts about the project, links to related materials, and minor status updates about my active investigations.
- [Targets](/priority/targets) - Think of these as "Reports to Management." These are the more official posts I make to declare specific project goals and track progress toward them.
- [Results](/priority/results) - The point of the whole project — get the plans and build a calorie fountain for yourself.

# Get Involved

Think I'm crazy? Me too, but I'd love to hear *your* reasons. So go ahead. Tell me what I've missed, and then, who knows? May we can resolve those problems without having to throw out the entire thing.

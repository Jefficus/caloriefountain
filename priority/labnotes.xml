But aside from the light that came attached to my Aerogarden, I have zero experience with grow lights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how’s an inexperienced buyer like me supposed to choose?&lt;/p&gt;

The first refers to making decisions based on actual data, while the second refers to making sure I have &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the data. And now the very first time I try to apply those principles, I’ve run into an unexpected roadblock.&lt;/p&gt;

Are you imagining one of those little fiberglass deals in the corner of your yard that cycles the same 3 gallons of water round and round all afternoon? Or do you picture something bigger, like maybe the Trevi Fountain in Rome? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, size-wise, a calorie fountain will be somewhere between those two extremes, but this project isn't about pretty; it's about productivity. Here's what I think they might look like...&lt;/p&gt;

But most people have limited space to work with and don't want to spend all of their time managing the system, so in practice, the variety of foods available on your table will depend on which of its three basic modes you're operating in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that doesn’t mean my &lt;em&gt;lab&lt;/em&gt; has to be gadget-free. On the contrary. The more I can track and understand the variables in my setup, the better I’ll be able to diagnose problems as they arise, and steer the project toward simpler crops and methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question is: what data needs to be tracked, and how?&lt;/p&gt;

First: All the sources I could find about high calorie crops seem to have completely missed the seaweed option. Second: They all cited Jerusalem artichokes as one of the champion crops, even though it didn't make my top ten, once I'd factored in field area and time to harvest. And those surprises have taught me a useful lesson...&lt;/p&gt;

Today I found &lt;a href="https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/csv/food"&gt;this dataset&lt;/a&gt; that looks like a good place to start. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They cite the USDA Agricultural Research Service as their source, which seems credible. I'm going to take it on faith for now so I can stay focused on getting some code working, but I'm also flagging this post for later verification so I don't forget to come back.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>datasets</category><category>food</category><category>nutrition</category><category>target-minmax</category><category>verification-needed</category><guid>/posts/find-a-dataset-of-food-nutrition/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 07 Mar 2023 01:36:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Computing optimal crop mix</title><link>/posts/computing-optimal-crop-mix/</link><dc:creator>Jefferson Smith</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to finding the optimal crops to support a family, there are a number of factors to consider: how much space is available, how many people are being supported, what are their daily calorie requirements, what vitamins and minerals does each crop provide... There's a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; to consider. And it's not like I can pick just one “best” mix and build a one-size-fits-all system around that. I need to figure out the optimal mix for my own scenario while allowing other fountaineers to figure out the right mix for &lt;em&gt;theirs&lt;/em&gt; . Sounds complicated, right?&lt;/p&gt;

This suggests that I may need to devise something different...&lt;/p&gt;

To counter that, I’m employing a simple microproject protocol that I call Target Tracking. Here's how it works...&lt;/p&gt;

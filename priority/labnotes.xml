&lt;p&gt;To that end, I've built a data collection interface in Memento DB that I can run on my phone. This makes it very quick to capture the data, which means I will use it more frequently than I would a more cumbersome process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have not yet built the central data collection module, but it will have to support bulk upload from the phone, or it could alternately present a web interface for manual inputs. I'll have to think about what makes the most sense.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>equipment</category><category>sensors</category><category>target-kratky-tank</category><category>telemetry</category><guid>https://www.caloriefountain.org/posts/manualdatacapture/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 21 Mar 2023 20:28:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Single-shot containers</title><link>https://www.caloriefountain.org/posts/singleshotcontainers/</link><dc:creator>Jefferson Smith</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="float-right blogthumb" src="https://www.caloriefountain.org/posts/images/tangled-roots.jpg"&gt;My initial intent was to create open-volume containers of appx 4 sqft, but I've since realized that these are potentially problematic for some experiments, such as root crops, because they allow root networks to intermingle, so I need to be able to isolate the individual growing volumes.&lt;/p&gt;

This is of course practical, but completely avoids the question of predicting how big a tube to choose in the first place. To do that, we need to know how much water a given crop will need over its lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, the Kratky Tank target is also going to get some off-the-shelf sensor gear for calibration and verification. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B099R85F7Y"&gt;InkBird ITDS-01&lt;/a&gt; that measures TDS, EC, and water temperature &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B00132G102"&gt;HM Digital PH-200&lt;/a&gt; that measures pH and temperature.&lt;/li&gt;

- &lt;a href="https://rngr.net/resources/apps/ifertigate"&gt;iFertigate&lt;/a&gt; is a smartphone app put out by the US government that looks quite thorough, but unfortunately, it no longer seems to be available. 
- &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/hydrosolver/"&gt;Hydrosolver&lt;/a&gt; is a very promising console tool for Linux.
- ScienceHydroponics provides an &lt;a href="https://scienceinhydroponics.com/2016/03/the-first-free-hydroponic-nutrient-calculator-program-o.html"&gt;online solution&lt;/a&gt; that seems pretty capable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm noting these here for future reference, but for now, they seem a bit more advanced than I'm really qualified to explore. I think a better plan for now is to follow &lt;a class="bloglink" href="https://www.caloriefountain.org/posts/computingnutrientmix"&gt;the standard Masterblend formula&lt;/a&gt;, and then revisit these once I have a better understanding of what I'm doing.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>software</category><category>target-kratky-how</category><category>tools</category><guid>https://www.caloriefountain.org/posts/nutrientmixtureapps/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 18 Mar 2023 16:59:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>It's brain pickin' time</title><link>https://www.caloriefountain.org/posts/its-brain-pickin-time/</link><dc:creator>Jefferson Smith</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="float-right blogthumb" src="https://www.caloriefountain.org/posts/images/brain-picker.jpg"&gt;If I'm going to do this right, I have a lot to learn about biology, laboratory methods, agricultural science, etc. I could take the “crazy recluse trying to cure cancer in his basement with dryer lint” route, but I happen to live a few blocks from a university with a specialty in agricultural research and it would be a shame to waste such a great resource. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all my years of working and studying on campus, I've never actually made connections with anybody from the Ag Dept. But how hard can it be to knock on a few doors? Worst case, they dismiss me as crazy and call security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But best case? I find a potential collaborator who actually knows what they're doing.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>collaboration</category><category>expertise</category><category>partners</category><category>target-brainpick</category><guid>https://www.caloriefountain.org/posts/its-brain-pickin-time/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 18 Mar 2023 00:45:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Computing nutrient mix</title><link>https://www.caloriefountain.org/posts/computingnutrientmix/</link><dc:creator>Jefferson Smith</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="float-right blogthumb" src="https://www.caloriefountain.org/posts/images/nutrient-mix.jpg"&gt;Found a good explanation of &lt;a href="https://cropaia.com/blog/how-to-calculate-a-nutrient-solution-formula%5Bhow"&gt;how to calculate nutrient solutions&lt;/a&gt;, but that might be a bit too advanced for now. I think I should start with whatever the common practice is until I've established some baselines. &lt;em&gt;Then&lt;/em&gt; I can start tinkering with more advanced formulations and methods and compare them against the baseline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That common practice appears to be simply mixing Masterblend (in a standard ratio with Epsom Salt and Calcium Nitrate) at a standard proportion per gallon of water. The recipe (given &lt;a href="https://chilledgrowlights.com/blog/making-your-own-hydroponic-nutrients"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, for example) is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2.4 grams Masterblend 4-18-38 — dissolve in 1 gallon of water&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1.2 grams Epsom Salt — dissolve into Masterblend solution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2.4 grams Calcium Nitrate (15.5-0-0) — dissolve into previous solution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And note that it's important to do things in that specific order.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>methods</category><category>nutrients</category><category>target-kratky-how</category><guid>https://www.caloriefountain.org/posts/computingnutrientmix/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 17 Mar 2023 16:59:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Let there be lights</title><link>https://www.caloriefountain.org/posts/lighting-the-fountain/</link><dc:creator>Jefferson Smith</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="float-right blogthumb" src="https://www.caloriefountain.org/posts/images/fountain-godrays.jpg"&gt;Eventually, designing a cheap, efficient, and robust lighting system for the fountain is going to be a project of its own, but in the meantime I still need some kind of lighting in the lab to provide consistent, controllable conditions for my experiments. But aside from the light that came attached to my Aerogarden, I have zero experience with grow lights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how’s an inexperienced gardener like me supposed to choose?&lt;/p&gt;

These barcodes are scannable by my data entry tool (described above) which can then quickly pre-load the entry screen with the pertinent unit id and be ready for my readings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For completeness, each tank will have an ID and each plant within that tank will also have an ID. When individual specimens are seeding/planted, their IDs will be linked to the tank ID in which they're placed, so that measurements of the tank (temp, pH, etc) can be easily matched to the success metrics of the plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the record (in case anybody else is using Linux and wants to know about my toolchain) my tracking codes are simply the datestamp (to the second and without punctuation) of when the sample tag was printed. For example, the tag shown in the picture here is 20230318170214. This is printed over USB to a Dymo LabelManager 280, using the opensource dymoprint python script available &lt;a href="https://github.com/computerlyrik/dymoprint"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and rendered in the code128 barcode format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(For completeness, the command to produce the barcodes is: &lt;code&gt;dymoprint -c code128 "$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S)"&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>equipment</category><category>target-kratky-tank</category><category>tracking</category><guid>https://www.caloriefountain.org/posts/sampletaggingsystem/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 12 Mar 2023 23:22:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>

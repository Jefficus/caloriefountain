But most people have limited space to work with and don't want to spend all of their time managing the system, so in practice, the variety of foods available on your table will depend on which of its three basic modes you're operating in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that doesn’t mean my &lt;em&gt;lab&lt;/em&gt; has to be gadget-free. On the contrary. The more I can track and understand the variables in my setup, the better I’ll be able to diagnose problems as they arise, and steer the project toward simpler crops and methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question is: what data needs to be tracked, and how?&lt;/p&gt;

First: All the sources I could find about high calorie crops seem to have completely missed the seaweed option. Second: They all cited Jerusalem artichokes as one of the champion crops, even though it didn't make my top ten, once I'd factored in field area and time to harvest. And those surprises have taught me a useful lesson...&lt;/p&gt;

Today I found &lt;a href="https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/csv/food"&gt;this dataset&lt;/a&gt; that looks like a good place to start. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They cite the USDA Agricultural Research Service as their source, which seems credible. I'm going to take it on faith for now so I can stay focused on getting some code working, but I'm also flagging this post for later verification so I don't forget to come back.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>datasets</category><category>food</category><category>nutrition</category><category>target-minmax</category><category>verification-needed</category><guid>/posts/find-a-dataset-of-food-nutrition/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 07 Mar 2023 01:36:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Computing optimal crop mix</title><link>/posts/computing-optimal-crop-mix/</link><dc:creator>Jefferson Smith</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to finding the optimal crops to support a family, there are a number of factors to consider: how much space is available, how many people are being supported, what are their daily calorie requirements, what vitamins and minerals does each crop provide... There's a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; to consider. And it's not like I can pick just one “best” mix and build a one-size-fits-all system around that. I need to figure out the optimal mix for my own scenario while allowing other fountaineers to figure out the right mix for &lt;em&gt;theirs&lt;/em&gt; . Sounds complicated, right?&lt;/p&gt;

This suggests that I may need to devise something different...&lt;/p&gt;

To counter that, I’m employing a simple microproject protocol that I call Target Tracking. Here's how it works...&lt;/p&gt;

It conjures to mind an idyllic little garden feature, doesn't it? Burbling away in the corner of the yard and producing an endless supply of sweet nourishment — the very nectar of life, right? Well, the &lt;em&gt;visual&lt;/em&gt; might not be right — the actual fountain will be neither small nor pretty — but I’m willing to look past that, because the rest of that imagery is right on point. And that's more important than you might think...&lt;/p&gt;

But if there's one thing my years of experience have taught me, it's that websites done well suck up a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of time, so if I want to have any bandwidth left for the actual research, I need to come up with a way to manage this site &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; letting it cut into my working time. Let's take a look at the architectural choices I’ve made to deliver on that, and the reasons I made them.&lt;/p&gt;

Whether I plant indoors or outdoors, the bigger the farm, the more labor, materials, and time it will suck up — all of which is typically in short supply. So during the opening stages of this project, my biggest concern is going to be the calorie yield. I want to find the crops that can produce the most calories, in the smallest area, and the shortest time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But first I have to measure it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all my years of working and studying on campus, I've never actually made connections with anybody from the Ag Dept. But how hard can it be to knock on a few doors? Worst case, they dismiss me as crazy and call security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But best case? I find a potential collaborator who actually knows what they're doing.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>collaboration</category><category>expertise</category><category>partners</category><category>target-brainpick</category><guid>/posts/its-brain-pickin-time/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 18 Mar 2023 00:45:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Let there be lights</title><link>/posts/lighting-the-fountain/</link><dc:creator>Jefferson Smith</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="float-right blogthumb" src="/posts/images/fountain-godrays.jpg"&gt;Eventually, designing a cheap, efficient, and robust lighting system for the fountain is going to be a project of its own, but in the meantime I still need some kind of lighting in the lab to provide consistent, controllable conditions for my experiments. But aside from the light that came attached to my Aerogarden, I have zero experience with grow lights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how’s an inexperienced gardener like me supposed to choose?&lt;/p&gt;

The first refers to making decisions based on actual data, while the second refers to making sure I have &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the data. And now the very first time I try to apply those principles, I’ve run into an unexpected roadblock.&lt;/p&gt;

Are you imagining one of those little fiberglass deals in the corner of your yard that cycles the same 3 gallons of water round and round all afternoon? Or do you picture something bigger, like maybe the Trevi Fountain in Rome? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, size-wise, a calorie fountain will be somewhere between those two extremes, but this project isn't about pretty; it's about productivity. Here's what I think they might look like...&lt;/p&gt;

But most people have limited space to work with and don't want to spend all of their time managing the system, so in practice, the variety of foods available on your table will depend on which of its three basic modes you're operating in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that doesn’t mean my &lt;em&gt;lab&lt;/em&gt; has to be gadget-free. On the contrary. The more I can track and understand the variables in my setup, the better I’ll be able to diagnose problems as they arise, and steer the project toward simpler crops and methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question is: what data needs to be tracked, and how?&lt;/p&gt;

First: All the sources I could find about high calorie crops seem to have completely missed the seaweed option. Second: They all cited Jerusalem artichokes as one of the champion crops, even though it didn't make my top ten, once I'd factored in field area and time to harvest. And those surprises have taught me a useful lesson...&lt;/p&gt;

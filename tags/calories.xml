But most people have limited space to work with and don't want to spend all of their time managing the system, so in practice, the variety of foods available on your table will depend on which of its three basic modes you're operating in.&lt;/p&gt;

Whether I plant indoors or outdoors, the bigger the farm, the more labor, materials, and time it will suck up — all of which is typically in short supply. So during the opening stages of this project, my biggest concern is going to be the calorie yield. I want to find the crops that can produce the most calories, in the smallest area, and the shortest time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But first I have to measure it.&lt;/p&gt;

So many calories and nutrients, so quickly, and with nearly zero maintenance too. Too bad it tastes like soggy butt cheeks, right?&lt;/p&gt;
